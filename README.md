# Plotly & JavaScript

In this project we utilized JavaScript to create a webpage that allows visitors to explore a dataset of Belly Button Diversity
through interactive data visualizations along with Plotly for the creation of charts that invite to further exploration in this research.

## Overview of Study

For this study, biological researcher Roza introduces to her field-of-study in the documentation of many bacterial species. 

The website specializes in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.
Partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup that research candidate’s species. 

There is many Laboratories in the U.S. that have successfully synthesized meat through algae, fungi, and microorganisms found in plants, however this partnership its set out to find the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste.
Roza and the rest of the team launched this study based on the following hypothesis:

“The existence of a microorganism that can supply the next best taste […] this bacterium can be found on the human body, specifically in the belly button”
Samples of navels of people across the country were gathered, keeping the volunteers’ identity anonymous; each volunteer was assigned an ID number instead.

The dashboard presented on our website is accessible to researchers and volunteers, and contains the results of the type of bacteria that lives on each one of the participants.
